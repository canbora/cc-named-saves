# Named Saves
This is a CrossCode mod allows you to rename your save slots.

### How to use
Simply go into the save (or load) menu, and use the appropriate hotkey while hovering over the save slot you want to rename, and then enter the new name in the pop-up that will appear. You can also close the pop-up without submitting to retain the former save name, or submit empty text to revert the save name to the original number.

### Notes
 - Names are tied to slots, not saves. This means that saving over an older save retains the name while newly created slots are nameless.
 - Languages other than English are missing texts. If you would like to translate the texts to another language, please contact me.
 - Since there might be bugs I've missed, you are advised to make a backup of your saves before using this mod.
